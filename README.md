Express JS Static Boilerplate
============================

ExpressJS static boilerplate is a simple NodeJS Server using static files and directories for quick quality development and production.

History
-----------
I wrote more than two Web Apps using NodeJS as a server so here's why I did the boilerplate.

Some features
-----------
- Static directory and files
- Nodemon
- Grunt JS
- no Jade

Usage
-----------
On your terminal.

Install the node packages.
```ruby
sudo npm install
```

Run the server
```ruby
nodemon server.js
```

Open your browser on the address 'localhost:3000'

Done!
